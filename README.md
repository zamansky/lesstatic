lesstatic
==========

A simple Python based Static Site generator

I'm writing this because I'm a python guy and as nice as Jekyll is,
it's in Ruby.

### Features
 * Markdown and html processing
 * Pygments for code snippets
 * Jinja2 templates 
 * Written in Python
 * Simple configuration using yaml

## Take a look at the documentation [here](http://zamansky.github.io/lesstatic)

## Quickstart
 1. Download or clone from here
 2. cd into the lesstatic directory
 3. sudo pip install .
 4. create a new project with template files: **lesstatic --init some_new_directory_name**
 5. switch into that directory: **cd some_new_directory_name**
 6. start the building server: **lesstatic --serve**
 7. open a browser window to **http://localhost:8000**
 8. Edit the files as needed
 9. Ctrl-c to break out of the server
 10. Also, take a look at the demosite directory in the repository
